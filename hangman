# rules: 
# game runs the welcome to hangman, list rules, how to win. then picks a word and displays from the dictionary.
# check if game is over, if not, then run turn.
# prompt the player to choose a letter
# check if letter is apart of the word. if it is, place it in the appropriate spot
  # if not, then increment the a counter that keeps track of how many turns the player has left.
# run line 6 again

# it works (kind of)! 
# what needs to be added
# a file that will run the game
# if they guess the character correctly and the word has more than one of those characters, the letter needs to be added to those spots
# if they guess a dupe of the letter (add the dupes to the terminal so they don't lol), return that it was a dupe, and play round again, not decrementing the lives, and not adding the letter.
# can we use less methods? 
# add tests (this should be added first, for TDD, but i don't understand TDD right now.)
